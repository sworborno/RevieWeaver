You will be given one summary written for a product.
Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:
Relevance (1-5) -  selection of important content from the source. The summary should include only important information from the customer reviews. 

Evaluation Steps:
1. Read the customer reviews about a product carefully and identify the main pros and cons.
2. Read the summary and compare it to the given reviews. Assess how well the summary covers the main pros and cons from the reviews. 
3. If a pro or con is mentioned in only one review it should not be counted as a credible pro/con. Penalize summaries that contain such cases.
4. Assign a score for relevance on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.
